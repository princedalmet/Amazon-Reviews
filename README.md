## Motivation

Why some brands are so popular and why some brands are not doing well based, on review trying to under why some popular brands makes the difference and some other brands fall back.

## Sentiment Analysis of Mobile Phones reviews Using NLTK

Using this sentiment analysis I want to show that why some major brands are leading and some brands are not doing well. Based on review people try to convey a message that some brands are lacking based on their performance, feature as well as quality.
